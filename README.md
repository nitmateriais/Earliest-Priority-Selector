## User Guide ##
EPS was developed to select the first priority of a Patent Family core contained in records indexed in Derwent Innovations Index (DII) database.
The program works only with '.txt' files.

To treat a file, follow the steps below.

1. Paste the file to be treated (input file) in the Earliest-Priority-Selector folder.

2. Open the 'EARLIEST PRIORITY SELECTOR.py'.

3. Write the input file name in the field indicated. It is indispensable to add the file extention (.txt), otherwise the program will not run.

4. Write a name to the output file (different from the input file name). Again, it is indispensable to add the file extention (.txt).

5. Wait until the end of the treatment and then press 'enter' to finnish the process.
 The treated file (output file) will be located at the Earliest-Priority-Selector folder.
